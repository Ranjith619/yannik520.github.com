Note: I'm still working on this... and will be adding more information
(and diagrams also). Please send me your comments, suggestions or
improvements.</small>
<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p>Block devices offer storage for large amounts of data (like the hard
disks). They normally have moving parts and very slow to perform I/O
operations. Since the I/O operations are costly, the kernel tries to
extract the maximum performance by caching the data in memory. Since
the actual I/O is performed by the device drivers, the kernel provides
various hooks for device drivers to register their handlers.</p>
<p>Another requirement of the block device layer is to hide the
hardware specific characteristics and provide a unified API to access
the devices. For example, a file system like ext2 need not bother about
the low level details of the block device.</p>
<p>One more characteristic of the block devices is that when multiple
requests are submitted to the device, the performance depends
significantly on the sequence of the requests. Since hard disks have
moving parts, the performance is the maximum if all the requests are in
the same direction of the head. The kernel collects the I/O requests
and sorts them before calling the device driver routines to process
them. It also boosts the performance by clubbing multiple requests for
contiguous sectors. The algorithm that sorts the I/O requests is called
as the elevator algorithm.</p>
<h3>Access from the user space</h3>


<p>Block devices are accessed as special type of files, such as /dev/sda1, 
(with the file type as block device type). They are identified by their 
major and minor numbers. The device file stores these two values. The 
major number is used to identify the device driver and
the minor number is used to identify the partition within the device.
For example, the device driver for the hard disk will manage all the
partitions on the disk. It can be seen that the device files for
different partitions will have the same major number but will have
different minor numbers.</p>

<pre>$ file /dev/sda1
/dev/sda1: block special (8/1)
</pre>

<p>The kernel identifies the device only by the major and minor number
combination. The actual file is irrelevant for the kernel. The device
file can be located anywhere in the file system and there can be any
number of device files. All of them refer to the same device (and
partition).  For example, the partitions of the hard disk are normally 
named as hda1, hda2 etc under /dev folder. This is just a convention. 
We can create a device file /tmp/hda1 with the same major and minor 
number as /dev/hda1.&nbsp;Both point to the same device and the file 
system on it can be mounted using any file.</p>


<h3>Kernel layer</h3>


<p>The data from the block devices is accessed as blocks (defined by
the <a href="#SBH">structure buffer_head</a>).&nbsp;For example, when 
a file is read from the device, the file system handler for the read 
operation converts the file offset into a block number and issues a 
request to load that particular block.</p>

<p>Since the actual I/O has to be performed by the device drivers, the
block device layer defines various handlers to perform the actual
operations. It provides registration mechanisms for the device drivers
to register their handlers. Once this is done, the kernel calls the
registered handler to perform the actual operation.</p>

<p>The kernel also makes use of the elevator algorithm to sort the I/O
requests in the request queue. The kernel offers different types of
elevator algorithms. There are four algorithms available now - noop,
deadline, cfq and anticipatory.</p>

<h2>Kernel Infrastructure</h2>
<h3>
Important data structures</h3>

These are the important data structures used by the block device layer.<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">gendisk</p>

<p>This stores the information about a disk. The important fields are
queue, part and fops used to store the request queue, partition
information and the block device operations table respectively. The
part field points to an array of pointers to hd_structs each
representing a partition.</p>
<p>This device driver has to allocate the gendisk structure, load the
partition table, allocate the request queue and fill the other fields
in the gendisk structure.</p>
<div class="codesnippet">
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/source/include/linux/genhd.h?a=x86_64#L100" target="codewindow">struct gendisk</a> {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct hd_struct &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;**part;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct block_device_operations &nbsp; *fops;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; request_queue_t &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; *queue;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>
};<br>

</div>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">hd_struct</p>

<p>This stores the information about a partition on a disk.</p>
<div class="codesnippet">
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/source/include/linux/genhd.h?a=x86_64#L77" target="codewindow">struct hd_struct</a> {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sector_t &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; start_sector;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sector_t &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nr_sects;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; int &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;partno;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>
};<br>

</div>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">block_device</p>

<p>This is used to represent a block device in the kernel. This can
represent the entire disk or a particular partition. When the structure
represents a partition, the bd_contains field points to the device
object which contains the partition. The bd_part field points to the
partition structure of the&nbsp;device. In the structure representing
the device, the field bd_disk points to the gendisk structure of the
device.</p>
<p>This structure is created only when the device is opened. Note that
the device driver still creates the gendisk structure, allocates the
request queue and registers the structures with the kernel. But till
the device is actually opened (either by reading through a device file
or by mounting it), this structure will not be created.</p>
<p>The field bd_inode points to the inode in the bdev file system. The
device will be accessed as a block device type file. That inode that
represents that device file is stored in the bd_inodes list.</p>
<p>When the device file is opened for the first time, the kernel
allocates the block_device structure and fills the structures. This is
actually allocated by the function 
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/source/fs/block_dev.c?a=x86_64#L243" target="codewindow">bdev_alloc_inode</a>. This is called
when the inode in the bdev file system has to be allocated. This
allocates the space required for both the structures in a single buffer.</p>

</div>
<p style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="SBH">buffer_head</a></p>

<p>This structure describes a block of data in memory. b_data points to
the actual memory location where the data is present. The field
b_this_page is used to list all the buffers sharing the same page i.e.,
the b_data points to the same page.</p>
<div class="codesnippet">
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/source/include/linux/buffer_head.h?a=x86_64#L44" target="codewindow">struct buffer_head</a> {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; struct buffer_head &nbsp; *b_this_page;<br>

};<br>

</div>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">bio</p>
<p>This structure is used to represent an ongoing block I/O operation.
This is the basic unit of I/O for the block layer. When a block has to
be read from a device, the buffer_head structure (the represents the
data in memory) allocates a bio structure, fills the structure and
submits to the block layer.</p>

<div class="codesnippet">
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/source/include/linux/bio.h?a=x86_64#L64" target="codewindow">struct bio</a> {<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ...<br>
};<br>

</div>
<br>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">bio_vec</p>
<p>This represents a segment of data in memory as (page, offset,
length). The location in memory to which the I/O needs to be performed
is represented as segments. The bio structure points to an array of
such segments.</p>
<div class="codesnippet">
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/source/include/linux/bio.h?a=x86_64#L54" target="codewindow">struct bio_vec</a> {<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; bv_offset;<br>
};<br>

</div>
<p style="font-weight: bold;">request</p>
This is used to represent a pending I/O request. These are stored as a
list to the request queue (these are sorted by the elevator algorithm).
When a bio is submitted to the block layer, it tries to see if it can
be added to an existing request in the request queue. Such bio
structures are stored as a list and stored in bio field. The bi_next
field of the bio structure is used to store the next bio in the list.<br>
<br>
The elevator_private field is used to store the elevator specific data.
This is filled by the elevator algorithm (which is stored in the
request queue) at the time of allocating the request.<br>

This stores information about the pending requests and other
information required to manage the request queue like the elevator
algorithm.<br>

<h2>Kernel Operations</h2><br><h3>Device driver registration</h3>



<p>To support a disk, the device driver has to first register with the
kernel. The driver needs to allocate a gendisk for each disk and assign
a request queue for each gendisk. The gendisk structure is allocated using
alloc_disk by passing the number of minors (this is the number of
partitions - 1, so 1 would mean no partitions). The gendisk structures are 
registered using add_disk function.  The partition information is represented 
by the hd_struct and the partitions of a disk are stored as an array of 
hd_struct structures. alloc_disk allocates the array required for the 
partitions. The driver needs to fill the partition information if there 
are partitions.</p>

<p>The function 
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/source/block/ll_rw_blk.c?a=x86_64#L1680" target="codewindow">blk_init_queue</a> generally is used 
to allocate the request queue and it calls function 
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/source/block/ll_rw_blk.c?a=x86_64#L1718" target="codewindow">blk_init_queue_node</a> to complete 
its job. This blk_init_queue_node function fills most of the handlers in 
the request queue with the default handlers provided by the kernel. it sets
generic_unplug_device as&nbsp;the unplug handler of the queue (this
handler will be called to perform the actual I/O on the device).</p>

<p>This blk_init_queue_node function then calls the function 
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/source/block/ll_rw_blk.c?a=x86_64#L208" target="codewindow">blk_queue_make_request</a>. It initializes the
unplug_work structure with (blk_unplug_work, q) and the unplug_timer
with (blk_unplug_timeout, q). The timeout handler will be called when
the timer expires. The timer handler adds the unplug work structure to
the block work queue. This work queue is allocated by the block device
layer initialization function 
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/source/block/ll_rw_blk.c?a=x86_64#L3225" target="codewindow">blk_dev_init</a>. Function blk_dev_init is 
called by <a href="http://lxr.linux.no/source/block/genhd.c?a=x86_64#L315" target="codewindow">genhd_device_init</a> once.</p>

<p>blk_init_queue also assigns
the chosen elevator algorithm (it can be chosen at the boot time) by
calling elevator_init. 
<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/source/block/elevator.c?a=x86_64#L170" target="codewindow">elevator_init</a> gets the elevator type 
identified by the name and calls elevator_attach to attach the elevator 
to the queue. This calls the elevator_init_fn which allows the elevator
algorithm to initialize its data structures for the request queue.</p>


<p>The following diagram shows the call graph for blk_init_queue.</p>

<p><img style="width: 536px; height: 246px;" src="blkdevarch_files/cg_init26.png"></p>

<a href="http://lxr.linux.no/source/include/linux/fs.h?a=x86_64#L367" target="codewindow&quot;">struct block_device</a>
<p>The following diagram shows the relationship between various data 
structures related to block devices.</p><p><img style="width: 696px; height: 577px;" src="blkdevarch_files/gendisk26.png"></p>



<br><h3>Opening a device file</h3>



<p>A device can be read/written as a normal file. For example, file
system utilities access device files as regular files and write file
system meta data. The kernel accesses these devices when a file system
on the device is mounted.</p>



<p>File systems call <a href="http://lxr.linux.no/source/fs/inode.c?a=x86_64#L1385" target="codewindow">init_special_inode</a> function 
for special type files like device files. This function sets the file operations 
of the inode to def_blk_fops.  When the inode is opened, the kernel calls the 
open handler in this file operations table. &nbsp;The handler registered in
the def_blk_fops is blkdev_open.</p>



<p><img style="width: 778px; height: 604px;" alt="" src="blkdevarch_files/cg_bdev26.png"></p>



<p>When the kernel opens the device during mount, the function
get_sb_bdev, which reads the file system superblock from the device.
The details of both the code paths can be seen in the call graph. Both
the paths finally call bd_acquire. The inode is allocated from the
special block device file system. The inode allocation function
registered with this file system, bdev_alloc_inode, actually allocates
the structure bdev_inode which has space for the block_device and an
inode. Though the pointer to the inode field is returned by the inode
allocation function, iget5_locked, we know that there is a block_device
structure before the inode structure (this can be accessed by
manipulating the inode pointer). The function bdget initializes this
block device structure and the new inode structure.</p>



<p>Note that the gendisk and the partition information is not yet
assigned to the block device structure. This is done by the function
do_open. This function handles the case of opening the device file of a
partition. The funciton get_gendisk fills the number of partitions in
the disk. If the device is opened for the first time and there are
partitions, it calls bdget_disk to get the block device structure for
the whole disk and calls blkdev_get to open the disk. The open handler
of the block device operations table is called when the block device
structure of the whole disk is opened.</p>


<p>The following code snippet shows the important lines of code in the
bd_open function that setup the device structures for partitions. The
bd_contains field is set for the partition device to point to the
structure of the whole disk. Also, the bd_part is set to the
corresponding entry in the hd_struct array for the partition.</p>


<div class="codesnippet">

</div>
<p>  The block device is initialized now. Data can be read/written by
allocating bio structures and populating it (the bi_bdev field pointing
to the block device structure) and then calling submit_bio.</p>




<h3>Request submission</h3>



<p>Requests for I/O are submitted using the submit_bio function. The
bio structure is allocated using bio_alloc by passing the number of
segments so that the bio_vec array is allocated for the requested
segments. For example, the function submit_bh which is used to submit a
request for a block allocates and fills a bio structure and submits
using submit_bio.</p>

<h4>New request</h4>



<p>The function __make_request first calls elv_merge to see if the bio
structure can be merged into an existing request structure. The return
value contains the merge information. If it cannot be merged, the bio
has to be added to the request queue by creating a new request.</p>

<p>It tries to allocate a new request structure. If it is not able to
allocate a structure, it will wait till it can allocate a structure.
elv_set_request is called so that the elevator algorithm can add its
information to the request (stored in the elevator_private field of the
request structure).</p>

<h4>Elevator algorithm</h4>



<p>If the elevator algorithm determines that the bio structure can be
merged into an existing request, it indicates by the return value of
ELEVATOR_BACK_MERGE or ELEVATOR_FRONT_MERGE. It returns a pointer to a
request to which the bio structure has to be added. The return value
indicates where to add the bio in the request (back merge indicates
that the bio should be added at the end of bio structures in the
request).</p>

<p>Before merging, it calls the back_merge_fn or the front_merge_fn
field of the request queue (which in general are ll_back_merge_fn and
ll_front_merge_fn). These functions can check whether the back/front
merge can be performed on the request. The default functions verify if
the constraints like the maximum sectors in the request will be
violated after the request. The elevator algorithm only tells if the
request can be enlarged. It doesnt know about the device driver
constraints on requests. So, these callbacks allow the drivers to
control the merge operation.</p>

<p>The following diagram shows the relationship between the request
queue and the requests with one of the requests enlarged with a bio
structure.</p>

<p><img style="width: 786px; height: 550px;" src="blkdevarch_files/rq26.png"></p>Note 
that till now we have only talked about adding the requests to the
request queue. These actual I/O is performed by a concept of 'device
plugging' and 'unplugging'. When there are requests in the request
queue, the device is 'plugged' using the function blk_plug_device. This
starts an unplug timer with a delay as specified in the unplug_delay
field of the request queue.&nbsp;

<h3>Request handling</h3>



<p>The requests are handled when the device is unplugged. The function
called to unplug the device is&nbsp;generic_unplug_device or
__generic_unplug_device. The device can be unplugged if the unplug
timer expires or if there is a scarcity of request structures on the
queue, of it I/O has to be forced on the device (like sending special
commands to the device).</p>

<p>The function __generic_unplug_device deletes any timers, marks the
device as unplugged and calls the request_fn handler of the request
queue. The handler is supposed to process all the requests in the
request queue.</p>

<h2>Accessing the device</h2>

As mentioned above, the data on the device can be accessed inside the
kernel as blocks, or read from the user space as a normal file.
Read/write from the user space can be done in two ways - by issuing
read/write system call on the device file or mapping the device file
and reading/writing to the memory. The kernel ensures that the blocks
are cached and all the code paths make use of the cache.
<h3 class="western">Mapped I/O</h3>



<p>Each opened inode has an associated address space object which
stores the mapping information like the loaded pages etc. It has an
associated address space operation table with handlers to perform
operations on the address space like readpage, writepage etc.</p>



<p>When the file is mapped into memory the internal data
structures
(vm_area_struct) are updated to specify that the mapped memory area
is a valid one. With demand paging, the read is triggered only when
there is a page fault. The write
handlers of the address space will trigger a write operation to the
device.</p>

<p>When the device file is opened for the first time, the function
bdget sets the a_ops field of the inode-&gt;i_data to def_blk_aops. The
i_mapping field of the special inode points to this i_data field in the
inode itself. This value from the special device inode is copied into
the i_mapping field of the inode for the device file (with which the
device is opened). So, if the device file is opened with n inodes (for
example, if we create /dev/hda1, /tmp/hda1, /tmp/hdA1 all having the
same major and minor numbers and open all the files) the i_mapping
fields of all the inodes will share the same mapping with the special
device inode i.e., all point to the i_data field of the special device
inode.</p>

<p>The handler for readpage is blkdev_readpage. This calls
block_read_full_page to which checks whether the page has associated
buffers required and if they are uptodate. If not, it calls submit_bh
for all the buffers that are not uptodate.</p>

<h3 class="western">System calls</h3>



<p>Read and write system calls delegate the task to the handlers
in
the file operation table. The file operation table for the block
devices is generally set to def_blk_fops (set by the function
init_special_inode which is called by all file systems). The read and
write handlers in this table are generic_file_read and
generic_file_write.</p>



<p>The function generic_file_read looks up for the pages in the
page
cache and if it is not present, calls the readpage handler of the
address space object. So, this actually calls the blkdev_readpage handler.</p>



<p>The function generic_file_write uses the prepare_write and
commit_write handler of the address space operations table to write
the data to the buffer. The corresponding handlers in the def_blk_fops
table are generic_prepare_write and generic_commit_write. The
function generic_commit_write marks the buffers as dirty as well as
adding the
inode to the dirty inodes of the superblock (so that the files can be
flushed before unmounting).</p>



<h3 class="western">Getting a buffer</h3>



<p>__bread is used to read a block from a device. This first
checks
if the buffer is available in the cache. Instead of maintaining a
separate buffer cache, the kernel makes use of the page cache. The
pages of data loaded from a file (inode) are cached and are accessed
using its address space object. The offset of the page is used to
locate the page in the cache.</p>

<p>To check if the block is available in the page cache, the block
number is converted into the page number with in the inode i.e., the
index of the page which will contain the required block is computed.
For example, if the block size is 1k and page size is 4k and the
request is to read block number 11, the corresponding page is 3 (with 4
blocks per page, 11th block falls in the 3rd page). If there is a page
for the page index and there is a buffer_head for the required block
number, it is returned.</p>

<p>If it is not able to find the buffer head (even if it finds a valid
page), it tries to find or create a page and allocate buffer structures
to it. Finally it would have found or created a page with buffer
structures. if the buffer is not valid, it submits the buffer for I/O
using submit_bh.</p>

<p>The following diagram shows the call graph for __bread.</p>
