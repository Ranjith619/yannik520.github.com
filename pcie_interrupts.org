* Interrupt Types in PCI Express
There are three interrupt types in PCI Express. They are as follows:
1. Legacy Interrups
2. MSI Interrupts
3. MSI-X Interrupts

** Legacy Interrupts
In PCI Express, four physical interrupt signals (INTA-INTD) are defined as in-band messages. 
When the core needs to generate a legacy interrupt, it sends INTA-INTD message upstream which 
whould ultimately be routed to the system interrupt controller.

The assert INTx message will result in the assertion of INTx line virtually to the 
interrupt controller and the Deassert INTx message will result in deassertion of the INTx line.

When a Legacy device delivers an Assert_INTx message, it also sets its Interrupt Pending 
bit located in memory or I/O space and also sets the Interrupt Pending bit located within the Configuration 
Status register. Figure 2 shows a snap shot of the interrupt status register.
