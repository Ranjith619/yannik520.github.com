* The Introduction of SDIO
The SD standard offers great flexibility, include the ability to use the SD slot
for more than memory cards. SDIO card is an interface that extends the functionality of 
devices by using a standard SD card slot to give devices new capabilities. A partial list
of new capabilities incudes:
 + GPS
 + Camera
 + Wi-Fi
 + Ethernet
 + Barcode readers
 + Bluetooth

The SDIO (SD Input/Outpu) card is based on and compatible with the SD memory card. This
compatibility incudes mechanical, electrical, power, signaling and software. The intent of
the SDIO card is to provide high-speed data I/O with low power consumption for mobile
electronic deivices.

** SDIO Features
+ Targeted for partable and stationary applications
+ Minimal or no modification to SD Physical bus is required
+ Minimal change to memory driver software
+ Extended physical form faactor available for specialized applications
+ Plug and play (PnP) support
+ Multi-function support including multiple I/O and combined I/O and memory
+ Up to 7 I/O functions plus one memory supported on one card.
+ Allows card to interrupt host.
+ Operational Voltage range: 2.7-3.6V
+ Application Specifications for Standard SDIO Functions.
+ Multiple Form Factos:
  - Full-Size SDIO
  - miniSDIO

* SDIO Signaling Definition
** SDIO Card Types
+ Full-Speed card:
- supports SPI, 1-bit SD and the 4-bit SD transfer modes at the full clock range of 0-25MHz.
- Over 100Mb/second (10MB/Sec)
+ Low-Speed SDIO card:
- Requires only the SPI and 1-bit SD transfer modes. 4-bit support is optional.
- Support a full clock range of 0-400 KHz

** SDIO Card modes
*** SPI (Card mandatory support)
In  this mode pin 8, which is undefined for memory, is used as the interrupt pin.
*** 1-bit SD Data Transfer Mode (Card Mandatory Support)
In this mode, data is transfered on the DAT[0] pin only.
*** 4-bit SD Data Transfer Mode (Mandatory for Hight-Speed Cards, Optional for Low-Speed)
In this mode, data is transferred on all 4 data pins (DAT[3:0]). The 4-bit SD mode provides the hightest data transfer possible, up to 100Mb/sec.
